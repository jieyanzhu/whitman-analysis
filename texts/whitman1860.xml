               <l>Northward, young men of Mannahatta—the target <lb/>company from an excursion returning home at <lb/>evening—the musket-muzzles all bear bunches <lb/>of flowers presented by women;</l>

               <l>The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun <lb/>and then toward the earth,</l>
               <l>The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted <lb/>faces and guttural exclamations,</l>

                  <l>Men and women crowding fast in the streets—if they <lb/>are not flashes and specks, what are they?</l>
                  <l>The streets themselves, and the façades of houses, and <lb/>goods in the windows,</l>
                  <l>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-planked wharves—the <lb/>huge crossing at the ferries,</l>
                  <l>The village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset— <lb/>the river between,</l>
                  <l>Shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs and <lb/>gables of white or brown, three miles off,</l>
                  <l>The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the <lb/>tide—the little boat slack-towed astern,</l>
                  <l>The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, <lb/>slapping,</l>
                  <l>The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of maroon- <lb/>tint, away solitary by itself—the spread of purity <lb/>it lies motionless in,</l>

                  <l>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance <lb/>of salt-marsh and shore-mud;</l>
                  <l>These became part of that child who went forth every <lb/>day, and who now goes, and will always go forth <lb/>every day,</l>
                  <l>And these become part of him or her that peruses <lb/>them here.</l>

               <l>O I do not know what you mean, there underneath <lb/>yourselves—you are not happiness,</l>

               <l>Death or life I am then indifferent—my Soul <choice><orig>de-<lb/>clines</orig><reg>declines</reg></choice> to prefer,</l>
               <l>I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes <lb/>death most;</l>
               <l>Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>cisely</orig><reg>precisely</reg></choice> the same as you mean;</l>
               <l>Grow up taller, sweet leaves, that I may see! Grow <lb/>up out of my breast!</l>
               <l>Spring away from the concealed heart there!</l>

               <l>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my <lb/>breast!</l>
               <l>Come, I am determined to unbare this broad breast of <lb/>mine—I have long enough stifled and choked;</l>
               <l>Emblematic and capricious blades, I leave you—now <lb/>you serve me not,</l>
               <l>Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself,</l>
               <l>I will escape from the sham that was proposed to me,</l>
               <l>I will sound myself and comrades only—I will never <lb/>again utter a call, only their call,</l>
               <l>I will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through <lb/>The States,</l>
               <l>I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent <lb/>shape and will through The States;</l>

               <l>Give me yourself—for I see that you belong to me <lb/>now above all, and are folded together above all <lb/>—you Love and Death are,</l>
               <l>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what <lb/>I was calling life,</l>
               <l>For now it is conveyed to me that you are the <choice><orig>pur-<lb/>ports</orig><reg>purports</reg></choice> essential,</l>
               <l>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for <lb/>reasons—and that they are mainly for you,</l>

               <l>Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but <lb/>soon I pass the gates,</l>

               <l>Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through <lb/>the stones, and partly cover them—Beyond these <lb/>I pass,</l>

               <l>Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and <lb/>then in the silence,</l>

               <l>Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some <lb/>embrace my arms or neck,</l>
               <l>They, the spirits of friends, dead or alive—thicker <lb/>they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,</l>
               <l>Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I <choice><orig>wan-<lb/>der</orig><reg>wander</reg></choice> with them,</l>

               <l>Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of <lb/>sage,</l>
               <l>And here what I now draw from the water, wading in <lb/>the pond-side,</l>
               <l>(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and <lb/>returns again, never to separate from me,</l>

               <l>These I, compassed around by a thick cloud of <lb/>spirits,</l>
               <l>Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them <lb/>loosely from me,</l>
               <l>Indicating to each one what he shall have—giving <lb/>something to each,</l>

               <l>Hours when I am forgotten, (O weeks and months are <lb/>passing, but I believe I am never to forget!)</l>
               <l>Sullen and suffering hours! (I am ashamed—but it <lb/>is useless—I am what I am;)</l>
               <l>Hours of my torment—I wonder if other men ever <lb/>have the like, out of the like feelings?</l>
               <l>Is there even one other like me—distracted—his <lb/>friend, his lover, lost to him?</l>
               <l>Is he too as I am now? Does he still rise in the <choice><orig>morn-<lb/>ing</orig><reg>morning</reg></choice>, dejected, thinking who is lost to him? and <lb/>at night, awaking, think who is lost?</l>

               <l>Does some stray reminder, or the casual mention of a <lb/>name, bring the fit back upon him, taciturn and <lb/>deprest?</l>
               <l>Does he see himself reflected in me? In these hours,<lb/>does he see the face of his hours reflected?</l>

               <l>And brought it away—and I have placed it in sight <lb/>in my room,</l>
               <l>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear <lb/>friends,</l>

               <l>Yet it remains to me a curious token—it makes me <lb/>think of manly love;</l>

               <l>Uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a <lb/>lover, near,</l>

<div1 type="part"><head type="main-authorial">WALT WHITMAN</head>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">FROM</hi> time to time echoes reach this country, from across the Atlantic, of controversies
regarding the literary and worldly well-being of the American poet, Walt Whitman. For instance,
Mr. Joaquin Miller delivers a lecture to an American audience, telling them that Whitman is
disgracefully treated by his countrymen; and forthwith some one writes from the United States to
a London review to say that Mr. Miller is all in the wrong, and the American public well
affected, and even affectionately disposed, towards Whitman. Lately the <hi>West Jersey
Press</hi> (26th January) has published an article named "Walt Whitman's Actual American
Position." It comes to us authenticated by Whitman's own words:&#8212;"My theory is that the plain
truth of the situation here is best stated; it is even worse than described in the article." It may,
therefore, interest some of our readers if we reproduce the principal passages:&#8212;</p>
<p>The real truth is that with the exception of a very few readers (women equally with men),
Whitman's poems in their public reception have fallen still-born in this country. They have been
met, and are met to-day, with the determined denial, disgust, and scorn of orthodox American
authors, publishers, and editors, and, in a pecuniary and worldly sense, have certainly wrecked
the life of their author.</p>

<p>"From 1845 to 1855 Whitman, then in Brooklyn and New York cities, bade fair to be a good
business man, and to make his mark and fortune in the usual way&#8212;owned several houses, was
worth some money, and 'doing well.' But, about the latter date, he suddenly abandoned all, and
commenced writing poems, got possessed by the notion that he must make epics or lyrics, 'fit for
the New World.' . . . . Little or no impression (at least ostensibly) seems to have been made. Still
he stands alone. No established publishing house will yet publish his books. Most of the stores
will not even sell them. In fact, his works have never been really published at all. Worse still; for
the last three years he left them in charge of book agents in New York city, who, taking
advantage of the author's illness and helplessness, have, three of them, one after another,
successively thievishly embezzled every dollar of the proceeds!</p>
<p>"Repeated attempts to secure a small income by writing for the magazines during his illness have
been utter failures. The <hi>Atlantic</hi> will not touch him. His offerings to <hi>Scribner</hi> are
returned with insulting notes; the <hi>Galaxy</hi> the same. <hi>Harper's</hi> did print a couple of
his pieces two years ago, but imperative orders from head-quarters have stopped anything
further. All the established American poets studiously ignore Whitman. . . . . But the poet himself
is more resolute and persevering than ever. 'Old, poor, and paralyzed,' he has, for a twelve-month
past, been occupying himself by preparing, largely with his own handiwork, here in Camden, a
small edition of his complete works in two volumes, which he himself now sells, partly 'to keep
the wolf from the door' in old age, and partly to give, before he dies, as absolute an expression as
may be to his ideas. 'Leaves of Grass' is mainly the same volume previously issued, but has some
small new pieces, and gives two characteristic portraits. Of 'Two Rivulets' he has printed the
newer parts here in Camden."</p></div1>-->
