               <l>All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the <lb/>branches;</l>

               <l>And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves <lb/>upon it, and twined around it a little moss,</l>
               <l>And brought it away&#8212;and I have placed it in sight in <lb/>my room;</l>
               <l>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,</l>

               <l>All the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail <lb/>before me again;</l>
               <l>The crashing and smoking&#8212;the pride of the men in <lb/>their pieces;</l>

               <l>After firing, I see him lean aside, and look eagerly off <lb/>to note the effect;</l>
               <l>&#8212;Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging&#8212; <lb/>(the young colonel leads himself this time, with <lb/>brandish'd sword;)</l>

               <l>Then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager <lb/>calls, and orders of officers;</l>

               <l>And ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, (rousing, <lb/>even in dreams, a devilish exultation, and all the <lb/>old mad joy, in the depths of my soul;)</l>
               <l>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions&#8212; <lb/>batteries, cavalry, moving hither and thither;</l>

               <l>S<hi>PIRIT</hi> whose work is done! spirit of dreadful hours!</l>
               <l>Ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of <choice><orig>bayo-<lb/>nets</orig><reg>bayonets</reg></choice>;</l>
               <l>Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever <lb/>unfaltering pressing;)</l>
               <l>Spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene! <lb/>Electric spirit!</l>
               <l>That with muttering voice, through the war now closed, <lb/>like a tireless phantom flitted,</l>
               <l>Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat <lb/>and beat the drum;</l>
               <l>&#8212;Now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to <lb/>the last, reverberates round me;</l>
               <l>As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return <lb/>from the battles;</l>
               <l>While the muskets of the young men yet lean over their <lb/>shoulders;</l>
               <l>While I look on the bayonets bristling over their <choice><orig>shoul-<lb/>ders</orig><reg>shoulders</reg></choice>;</l>
               <l>While those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, <lb/>appearing in the distance, approach and pass <lb/>on, returning homeward,</l>
               <l>Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the <lb/>right and left,</l>
               <l>Evenly, lightly rising and falling, as the steps keep <lb/>time:</l>
               <l>&#8212;Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but <lb/>pale as death next day;</l>
               <l>Touch my mouth, ere you depart&#8212;press my lips close!</l>
               <l>Leave me your pulses of rage! bequeath them to me! <lb/>fill me with currents convulsive!</l>
               <l>Let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you <lb/>are gone;</l>
               <l>Let them identify you to the future, in these songs.</l>
