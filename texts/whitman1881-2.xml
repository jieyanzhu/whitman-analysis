               <l>(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)</l>
               <l>From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,</l>

               <l>For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere <lb/>of lovers,</l>
               <l>Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,</l>
               <l>(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)</l>   
               <l>Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same <lb/>as you mean,</l>
               <l>Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my <lb/>breast!</l>
               <l>Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!</l>
               <l>Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!</l>
               <pb facs="ppp.01663.103.jpg" xml:id="leaf054r" n="97" type="recto"/>
               <l>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!</l>
               <l>Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I <lb/>have long enough stifled and choked;</l>
               <l>Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me <lb/>not,</l>
               <l>I will say what I have to say by itself,</l>
               <l>I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a <lb/>call only their call,</l>
               <l>I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,</l>
               <l>I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and <lb/>will through the States,</l>
               <l>Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,</l>
               <l>Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,</l>
               <l>Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, <lb/>and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,</l>
               <l>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,</l>
               <l>For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,</l>
               <l>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that <lb/>they are mainly for you,</l>
               <l>That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,</l>
               <l>That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter <lb/>how long,</l>
               <l>That you will one day perhaps take control of all,</l>
               <l>That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,</l>
               <l>That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very <lb/>long,</l>
               <l>But you will last very long.</l>

               <l>Who oft as he saunter'd the streets curv'd with his arm the shoul <lb/>der of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon <lb/>him also.</l>

               <l>But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, <lb/>refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,</l>
               <l>When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in <lb/>the morning light,</l>
               <l>When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, <lb/>laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,</l>
               <l>And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way <lb/>coming, O then I was happy,</l>
               <l>O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food <lb/>nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,</l>
               <l>And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening <lb/>came my friend,</l>
               <l>And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly <lb/>continually up the shores,</l>
               <l>I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to <lb/>me whispering to congratulate me,</l>
               <l>For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover <lb/>in the cool night,</l>
               <l>In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined <lb/>toward me,</l>
               <l>And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that night I was <lb/>happy.</l>

               <l>The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of <lb/>listeners,</l>

               <l>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the <lb/>myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida,</l>
               <l>Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio <lb/>Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red <lb/>River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring <lb/>waters laughing and skipping and running,</l>
               <l>Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I <lb/>with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek <lb/>worms and aquatic plants,</l>
               <l>Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing <lb/>the crow with its bill, for amusement—and I triumphantly <lb/>twittering,</l>
               <l>The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh <lb/>themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels <choice><orig>out-<lb/>side</orig><reg>outside</reg></choice> move around with erect heads watching, and are from <lb/>time to time reliev'd by other sentinels—and I feeding <lb/>and taking turns with the rest,</l>

               <l>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the <lb/>countless workmen working in the shops,</l>
               <l>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in <lb/>myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,</l>
               <l>Singing the song of These, my
ever-united lands—my body no <lb/>more inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a <lb/>thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than <lb/>my lands are inevitably united and made O<hi rend="smallcaps">NE IDENTITY</hi>;</l>

                  <l>A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,</l>

                  <l>Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely <lb/>as she spoke.</l>

                  <l>Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,</l>

               <l>A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;</l>
               <l>What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?</l>
