               <l>(Know, once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are <lb/>men like me, are our lusty, lurking, masculine <lb/>poems;)</l>
               <l>Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding, <lb/>love-climbers, and the climbing sap,</l>
               <l>Arms and hands of love—lips of love—phallic thumb <lb/>of love—breasts of love—bellies press'd and <lb/>glued together with love,</l>
               <l>Earth of chaste love—life that is only life after love,</l>
               <l>The body of my love—the body of the woman I <lb/>love—the body of the man—the body of the <lb/>earth,</l>

               <l>The wet of woods through the early hours,</l>
               <l>Two sleepers at night lying close together as they <lb/>sleep, one with an arm slanting down across <lb/>and below the waist of the other,</l>

               <l>The limpid liquid within the young man,</l>
               <l>The vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful,</l>
               <l>The torment—the irritable tide that will not be at rest,</l>
               <l>The like of the same I feel—the like of the same in <lb/>others,</l>
               <l>The young man that flushes and flushes, and the <lb/>young woman that flushes and flushes,</l>
               <l>The young man that wakes, deep at night, the hot <lb/>hand seeking to repress what would master <lb/>him; </l>
               <l>The mystic amorous night—the strange half-welcome <lb/>pangs, visions, sweats,</l>

               <l>The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing <lb/>and naked,</l>
               <l>The merriment of the twin-babes that crawl over the <lb/>grass in the sun, the mother never turning her <lb/>vigilant eyes from them,</l>
               <l>The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening <lb/>or ripen'd long-round walnuts; </l>
               <l>The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,</l>
               <l>The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find <lb/>myself indecent, while birds and animals never <lb/>once skulk or find themselves indecent; </l>
               <l>The great chastity of paternity, to match the great <lb/>chastity of maternity,</l>
               <l>The oath of procreation I have sworn—my Adamic <lb/>and fresh daughters,</l>
               <l>The greed that eats me day and night with hungry <lb/>gnaw, till I saturate what shall produce boys to <lb/>fill my place when I am through,</l>
               <l>The wholesome relief, repose, content;</l>

               <l>Tomb-leaves, growing up above me, above <lb/>death,</l>
               <l>Perennial roots, tall leaves—O the winter shall not <lb/>freeze you, delicate leaves,</l>
               <l>Every year shall you bloom again—Out from where <lb/>you retired, you shall emerge again; </l>
               <l>O I do not know whether many, passing by, will <choice><orig>dis-<lb/>cover</orig><reg>discover</reg></choice> you, or inhale your faint odor—but I <lb/>believe a few will; </l>
               <l>O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit <lb/>you to tell, in your own way, of the heart that <lb/>is under you; </l>
               <l>O burning and throbbing—surely all will one day be <lb/>accomplish'd; </l>
               <l>O I do not know what you mean, there underneath <lb/>yourselves—you are not happiness,</l>
               <l>You are often more bitter than I can bear—you burn <lb/>and sting me,</l>
               <l>Yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged <lb/>roots—you make me think of Death,</l>
               <l>Death is beautiful from you—(what indeed is <choice><orig>beauti-<lb/>ful</orig><reg>beautiful</reg></choice>, except Death and Love?)</l>
               <l>O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my <lb/>chant of lovers—I think it must be for Death,</l>
               <l>For how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the <lb/>atmosphere of lovers,</l>
               <l>Death or life I am then indifferent—my Soul declines <lb/>to prefer,</l>
               <l>I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes <lb/>death most; </l>
               <l>Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>cisely</orig><reg>precisely</reg></choice> the same as you mean; </l>

               <l>Grow up taller, sweet leaves, that I may see! grow <lb/>up out of my breast!</l>
               <l>Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!</l>
               <l>Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots, <lb/>timid leaves!</l>
               <l>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my <lb/>breast!</l>
               <l>Come, I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of <lb/>mine—I have long enough stifled and choked: </l>
               <l>Emblematic and capricious blades, I leave you—now <lb/>you serve me not; </l>
               <l>Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself,</l>
               <l>I will escape from the sham that was proposed to <lb/>me,</l>
               <l>I will sound myself and comrades only—I will never <lb/>again utter a call, only their call,</l>
               <l>I will raise with it, immortal reverberations through <lb/>The States,</l>
               <l>I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent <lb/>shape and will through The States; </l>
               <l>Through me shall the words be said to make death <lb/>exhilarating; </l>
               <l>Give me your tone therefore, O Death, that I may <lb/>accord with it,</l>
               <l>Give me yourself—for I see that you belong to me <lb/>now above all, and are folded inseparably <choice><orig>to-<lb/>gether</orig><reg>together</reg></choice>—you Love and Death are; </l>
               <l>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I <lb/>was calling life,</l>
               <l>For now it is convey'd to me that you are the <choice><orig>pur-<lb/>ports</orig><reg>purports</reg></choice> essential,</l>
               <l>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons <lb/>—and that they are mainly for you,</l>
               <l>That you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the <lb/>real reality,</l>
               <l>That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, <lb/>no matter how long,</l>
               <l>That you will one day, perhaps take control of all,</l>

                  <hi rend="small caps">I SAW</hi> in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</l>
               <l>All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the <lb/>branches; </l>
               <l>Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous <lb/>leaves of dark green,</l>
               <l>And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think <lb/>of myself; </l>
               <l>But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, <lb/>standing alone there, without its friend, its <lb/>lover near—for I knew I could not; </l>
               <l>And I broke off a twig with a certain number of <lb/>leaves upon it, and twined around it a little <lb/>moss,</l>
               <l>And brought it away—and I have placed it in sight in <lb/>my room; </l>
               <l>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear <lb/>friends,</l>
               <l>(For I believe lately I think of little else than of <lb/>them;)</l>
               <l>Yet it remains to me a curious token—it makes me <lb/>think of manly love; </l>
               <l>—For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there <lb/>in Louisiana, solitary, in a wide flat space,</l>
               <l>Uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a <lb/>lover, near,</l>
               <l>I know very well I could not.</l>

            <l>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd, <lb/>with a look I shall never forget;</l>
            <l>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as <lb/>you lay on the ground;</l>
            <l>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested <lb/>battle;</l>
            <l>Till late in the night reliev'd, to the place at last again I <lb/>made my way;</l>
            <l>Found you in death so cold, dear comrade—found your <lb/>body, son of responding kisses, (never again on <lb/>earth responding;)</l>
            <l>Bared your face in the starlight—curious the scene— <lb/>cool blew the moderate night-wind;</l>
            <l>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me <lb/>the battle-field spreading;</l>
            <l>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant <lb/>silent night;</l>
            <l>But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh—Long, <lb/>long I gazed;</l>
            <l>Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, <lb/>leaning my chin in my hands;</l>
            <l>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with <lb/>you, dearest comrade—Not a tear, not a word;</l>
            <l>Vigil of silence, love and death—vigil for you, my son <lb/>and my soldier,</l>
            <l>As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones <choice><orig>up-<lb/>ward</orig><reg>upward</reg></choice> stole;</l>
            <l>Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you, <lb/>swift was your death,</l>

            <l>I faithfully loved you and cared for you living—I think <lb/>we shall surely meet again;)</l>
            <l>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the <lb/>dawn appear'd,</l>
            <l>My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his <lb/>form,</l>
            <l>Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, <lb/>and carefully under feet;</l>
            <l>And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my <lb/>son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I <choice><orig>de-<lb/>posited</orig><reg>deposited</reg></choice>;</l>
            <l>Ending my vigil strange with that—vigil of night and <lb/>battle-field dim;</l>

            <l>Vigil for comrade swiftly slain—vigil I never forget, <lb/>how as day brighten'd,</l>
            <l>I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well <lb/>in his blanket,</l>
            <l>And buried him where he fell.</l>

               <hi rend="small caps">A MARCH</hi> in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown;</l>
            <l>A route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the <lb/>darkness;</l>
            <l>Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant <lb/>retreating;</l>
            <l>Till after midnight glimmer upon us, the lights of a <lb/>dim-lighted building;</l>
            <l>We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the <lb/>dim-lighted building;</l>
            <l>'Tis a large old church, at the crossing roads—'tis now <lb/>an impromptu hospital;</l>
            <l>—Entering but for a minute, I see a sight beyond all <lb/>the pictures and poems ever made:</l>
            <l>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving <lb/>candles and lamps,</l>
            <l>And by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red <lb/>flame, and clouds of smoke;</l>
            <l>By these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely I see, on the <lb/>floor, some in the pews laid down;</l>
            <l>At my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in <lb/>danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the <choice><orig>ab-<lb/>domen</orig><reg>abdomen</reg></choice>;)</l>
            <l>I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is <lb/>white as a lily;)</l>
            <l>Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene, <lb/>fain to absorb it all;</l>
            <l>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in <lb/>obscurity, some of them dead;</l>
            <l>Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell <lb/>of ether, the odor of blood;</l>

            <pb facs="ppp.00473.383.jpg" xml:id="leaf194r" n="45a" type="recto"/>

            <l>The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiers <lb/>—the yard outside also fill'd;</l>
            <l>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, <lb/>some in the death-spasm sweating;</l>
            <l>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders <lb/>or calls;</l>
            <l>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the <lb/>glint of the torches;</l>
            <l>These I resume as I chant—I see again the forms, I <lb/>smell the odor;</l>
            <l>Then hear outside the orders given, <hi rend="italic">Fall in, my men,</hi> 
               <lb/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fall in;</hi> 
              </l>
            <l>But first I bend to the dying lad—his eyes open—a <lb/>half-smile gives he me;</l>
            <l>Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to <lb/>the darkness,</l>
            <l>Resuming, marching, as ever in darkness marching, on <lb/>in the ranks,</l>
            <l>The unknown road still marching.</l>

            <l>Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my <lb/>bay, she was 600 feet long,</l>
            <l>Her moving swiftly, surrounded by myriads of small <lb/>craft, I forget not to sing;</l>

            <l>And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the <choice><orig>mys-<lb/>tic</orig><reg>mystic</reg></choice> midnight passes,</l>
            <l>And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just <lb/>hear, the breath of my infant,</l>
            <l>There in the room, as I wake from sleep, this vision <lb/>presses upon me:</l>
            <l>The engagement opens there and then, in my busy brain <lb/>unreal;</l>
            <l>The skirmishers begin—they crawl cautiously ahead— <lb/>I hear the irregular snap! snap!</l>
            <l>I hear the sounds of the different missiles—the short <lb/>

            <l>I see the shells exploding, leaving small white clouds— <lb/>I hear the great shells shrieking as they pass;</l>
            <l>The grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the <lb/>trees, (quick, tumultuous, now the contest rages!)</l>
            <l>All the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail <lb/>before me again;</l>
            <l>The crashing and smoking—the pride of the men in <lb/>their pieces;</l>
            <l>The chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects <lb/>a fuse of the right time;</l>
            <l>After firing, I see him lean aside, and look eagerly off <lb/>to note the effect;</l>
            <l>—Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging— <lb/>(the young colonel leads himself this time, with <lb/>brandish'd sword;)</l>
            <l>I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly <lb/>fill'd up—no delay;)</l>
            <l>I breathe the suffocating smoke—then the flat clouds <lb/>hover low, concealing all;</l>

            <l>Now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot <lb/>fired on either side;</l>
            <l>Then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager <lb/>calls, and orders of officers;</l>
            <l>While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts <lb/>to my ears a shout of applause, (some special <lb/>success;)</l>
            <l>And ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, (rousing, <lb/>even in dreams, a devilish exultation, and all the <lb/>old mad joy, in the depths of my soul;)</l>
            <l>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions— <lb/>batteries, cavalry, moving hither and thither;</l>
            <l>(The falling, dying, I heed not—the wounded, dripping <lb/>and red, I heed not—some to the rear are <choice><orig>hob-<lb/>bling</orig><reg>hobbling</reg></choice>;)</l>
            <l>Grime, heat, rush—aid-de-camps galloping by, or on a <lb/>full run;</l>
            <l>With the patter of small arms, the warning <hi rend="italic">s-s-t</hi> of the <lb/>rifles, (these in my vision I hear or see,)</l>
            <l>And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd <lb/>rockets.</l>

                  <l>Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing,<lb/>and the voices of children and women,</l>
                  <l>The many-moving sea-tides,—and I saw the ships how they <lb/>sail'd,</l>
                  <l>And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields <lb/>all busy with labor,</l>
                  <l>And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each <lb/>with its meals and minutia of daily usages; </l>
                  <l>And the streets, how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities <lb/>pent,—lo! then and there,</l>
                  <l>Falling among them all, and upon them all, enveloping me <lb/>with the rest,</l>
                  <l>Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail;</l>
                  <l>And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge <lb/>of death.</l>
